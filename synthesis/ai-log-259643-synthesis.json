The recommendation is based on qualitative assessment of speed and capability gaps, but no quantified comparison shows what happens to IRR, NPV, or payback under each option. This means the decision-maker is being asked to commit to a path based on logical framing rather than financial evidence. The 35-40% internal confidence level cited in the analysis should apply to the recommendation itself, not just the market opportunity.",

Produce a single-page comparison table showing IRR and payback ranges for each scenario. This would convert the current qualitative recommendation into a quantified decision with explicit risk bounds.",
    "underweighted_risk": "Partner dependency risk in the Hybrid model is systematically underweighted. The analysis assumes partner capabilities can be leveraged for Q1 2026 launch without validating: (1) whether suitable partners exist and are available, (2) what terms they would require, (3) how partner incentives align with corporate objectives, and (4) what happens if the partnership fails mid-execution. The analysis treats 'Hybrid Partnership' as a capability that can be activated, when it is actually a complex negotiation with uncertain outcomes. A failed partnership attempt could result in worse outcomes than either the Internal Build or Acquisition paths."
