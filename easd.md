Innovera Strategic Decision Intelligence Framework
Overview
When someone asks:
“How do you know this is the right recommendation?”
What they’re really asking is:
“Can I trust that this recommendation is sound, defensible, and has the highest expected value given what we know?”
They don’t need clairvoyance. They need clarity, completeness, and confidence in the process.
We can’t guarantee the outcome. But what we can guarantee is the best recommendation given all of the available data at a point in time that accounts for risks and tradeoffs and ensures we’ve left no stone unturned.
In short: We’ve done the work to ensure this is the best decision with all of the information available at the time.”

Decision Integrity Statement
To convey confidence in our analysis - all of our model results must include:
The clear recommendation
What we did
What we tested
What risks we acknowledge
Why this path is preferred vs. others


Decision Model Formulation Process
1. Define the Decision
Frame a clear, actionable question with real alternatives
Include the objective function: What are we optimizing for? (Returns, strategic fit,, etc.)
Identify the decision owner (who ultimately chooses and owns the outcome)
2. Identify Key Uncertainties
What assumptions or variables drive the most variance?
Which factors do we have confidence in, and which remain fuzzy?
What are the baseline assumptions (a-priori) that are being brought forward?
3. Create Decision Tree Branches
Define the main decision node and each meaningful alternative
Define positive and negative scenarios and make status quo or do-nothing as baseline
Include market factors, execution success/failure, competitive moves, regulatory shifts
Capture real options (e.g., test vs. full launch, delay vs. act now)
4. Assign Values (and later Probabilities)
Use the same units across paths (e.g., NPV, IRR, strategic score)
Assign estimated probabilities for each scenario using the best available data
Use ranges and confidence intervals when possible (not just point estimates)
5. Calculate Expected Value / Utility
Roll back expected values through the tree
Optionally simulate using Monte Carlo or probabilistic modeling 
Make tradeoffs explicit: risk vs. return, speed vs. control, strategic gain vs. capital risk
6. Analyze Path Options
Risk profile — What’s the downside risk and variance?
Resource requirements — Capital, time, talent required
Implementation complexity — Ease of execution or barriers
Strategic alignment — Fit with portfolio, long-term vision, ESG, etc.
Flexibility — Which path preserves optionality or adaptability?
7. Document the Decision Process
What was decided — and what wasn’t
Why certain paths were rejected
The known risks and knowledge gaps
Any follow-ups or contingency triggers
The set of assumptions, models, and sources

III. Model Confidence Framework (E × A × S × D)
A practical tool for evaluating the analytical quality of investment memos. Use it to pressure-test assumptions, clarify confidence, and surface blind spots. Designed for internal reviews, side-by-side memo comparisons, or mentoring junior teams.
Does this memo enable a decision to be made confidently, transparently, and defensibly?
1 - (E) Evidence Strength  
Are inputs strong enough to confidently support a high-stakes decision?
Source Diversity - Are multiple types of sources used (internal, external, open, expert)?
Data Validity - Is the data recent, credible, and appropriate for this context?
Traceability - Are key claims linked to identifiable, verifiable sources?
Data Coverage - Are all critical dimensions (market, team, financials, etc.) covered?
2 - (A) Assumption Rigor 
Do assumptions withstand scrutiny and eliminate hidden risk?
Transparency - Are major assumptions clearly stated and separated from facts?
Validation - Are assumptions supported by data, benchmarks, or expert input?
Inflection Points - Are the most sensitive variables that can swing the decision identified and explored?
Limitations & Uncertainty - Are model gaps, exclusions, blind spots or simplifications openly acknowledged and disclosed?
3 - (S) Scenario Robustness - Does the model expose both upside and downside to guide confident action?
Scenario Depth - Are base, upside, downside, and edge cases modeled?
Sensitivity Testing - Are key drivers varied and stress-tested to test decision durability?
Tradeoff Visibility - Are risks, costs, and opportunity costs clearly surfaced?
Time Horizon - Are short-, mid-, and long-term outcomes addressed?
4 - (D) Decision Coherence - Is the reasoning sound, consistent, and structured to drive a confident, defensible choice?
Decision Framing  - Is there a clear, actionable decision question with defined alternatives?
Logical Flow - Does the analysis connect cleanly from data to insight to recommendation?
Insight Maturity - Does it go beyond surface-level points to reveal new insight?
Conclusion Clarity - Is the recommendation specific, justified, and actionable?
C = E x A x S x D
C = Confidence Level
E = Evidence strength
A = Assumption rigor
S = Scenario robustness
D = Decision coherence

What this should drive is a meaningful Delta from the inputs that we have received:
Does the output introduce ideas not directly inferable from the initial data provided?
If you remove the client’s brief, would the output still introduce new, valuable perspectives?
Does this insight change what the client will prioritize, build, fund, or discard?
Would a decision-maker act differently after reading this?
Would a domain expert say, “That’s interesting — I hadn’t considered that”?
This should also support Resilience and Repeatability:
Resilience - slight changes do not impact results 
Repeatability – running same analysis again returns 90%+ same results 
How Innovera drives EASD through platform features (existing and roadmap):

E, A, S, and D become the QA framework for each agent’s output:
Are the insights usable?
Are the assumptions surfaced and tested?
Are risks modeled, not handwaved?
Is the decision logic complete?

Evidence (E)
Source Linking & Traceability: Tag every claim or insight to its originating source (internal doc, dataset, external report)
Data Quality Flagging: Automated checks for recency, type (quant vs. qual), and credibility of sources
Perspective Diversity: Pulls in competitor benchmarks, public market data, and voice-of-customer inputs
Source Library Management: Reusable tagged data assets across memos, reducing duplicative research

Assumptions (A)
Assumption Extraction: Identifies and categorizes implicit and explicit assumptions from documents or memos
Validation Scoring: Benchmarks assumptions against market norms, historical data, or external comparisons
Overconfidence Detection: Flags unsupported certainty or one-sided modeling
Assumption Tracker: Dynamic table of key assumptions with evidence, confidence level, and implications

Scenarios (S)
Scenario Generator: Auto-generates base, upside, downside, and edge cases from a single business model
Sensitivity Analyzer: Tests key input variables and quantifies impact range on outcomes
Tradeoff Explorer: Visualizes cost/benefit, time/impact, or risk/return tradeoffs across paths
Comparative Path Analysis: Structured comparison of 2–3 distinct strategic alternatives

Decision (D)
Decision Tree Builder: Map alternatives, branches, probabilities, and values in a visual logic flow
Confidence Threshold Triggering: Tells you when your decision memo meets the readiness standard to act
Memo-to-Model Alignment: Ensures that the final recommendation is consistent with modeled logic
Alternatives Comparison Module: Ensures “do nothing,” delay, and alternate strategies are all surfaced
Conclusion Clarity Audit: Flags when the recommendation lacks specificity, justification, or actionability
IV. Decision Confidence Threshold (DCT)
The DCT is a formal, defensible standard that tells us: “We have enough clarity, validation, and foresight to move forward.” It’s the line in the sand where analysis ends and action begins.
A recommendation must meet a minimum standard to be considered decision-ready. The DCT provides that threshold, ensuring:
The evidence is credible and multi-sourced (E)
The assumptions are transparent and tested (A)
Scenarios explore tradeoffs and edge cases (S)
The decision logic is coherent and unambiguous (D)
DCT is not about perfection, it’s about knowing whether a decision is structurally sound based on what we know today. It ensures:
The right questions were asked
The risks are visible and quantified
There is no fatal blind spot in logic or assumptions
A decision that passes the DCT can be confidently explained, defended, and executed.
